    "description": "## Overview\n\nThe OpenxAI Decentralized Infrastructure Fund, powered by Openmesh Xnode, establishes the core infrastructure for decentralized AI compute, storage, and networking. Xnode, a decentralized virtual machine similar to AWS EC2, eliminates reliance on centralized cloud providers by leveraging Openmesh's bare-metal and cloud-independent architecture. This ensures permissionless, scalable, and distributed computing, allowing AI models to execute seamlessly across a global network of independent nodes. AI without censorship. Your AI. Your Rules. No Middlemen.\n\nXnode dynamically provisions compute resources, optimizes workload distribution, and ensures high availability for AI developers and researchers. Unlike traditional cloud-based AI execution, it provides censorship-resistant, cost-efficient, and fully decentralized AI computation, making OpenxAI independent from corporate cloud monopolies.\n\nDeploying and maintaining this infrastructure requires compute node deployment, network load balancing, security hardening, and AI model execution automation to ensure reliability and scalability.\n\n## Scope of Work\n- Aggregate the most powerful open source AI models and integrate into OpenxAI Studio.\n- Deploy and configure Xnode-powered compute clusters across Openmesh's decentralized infrastructure to support AI data sets and model training workloads.\n- Set up decentralized storage infrastructure to facilitate AI data availability, ensuring that datasets and model artifacts are distributed securely and redundantly across the network.\n- Develop and integrate automated resource allocation algorithms to optimize compute scheduling and efficiently allocate workloads based on demand and node availability.\n- Implement security protocols and failover mechanisms to prevent data loss, secure model execution, and maintain 99.9% uptime across AI workloads.\n- Conduct performance benchmarking and stress testing to validate system stability, ensuring OpenxAI can support high-intensity AI computations in real-world scenarios.\n- Optimize GPU-based AI execution pipelines for decentralized environments, enabling seamless data processing and AI model training across Openmesh's compute network.",

    "description": "## Overview\n\nMilestone-Based Fair Launch, TGE & Uniswap Setup is a structured token distribution model similar to Kickstarter, ensuring that funds are allocated transparently and responsibly based on achievable project milestones rather than speculative hype. Unlike traditional token launches (ICOs, IDOs, INOs) where funds are raised upfront without accountability, this methodology ties funding releases directly to project progress through smart contracts, verified by the community, ensuring that funds are escrowed using smart contracts and deployed only when milestones are met.\n\n$20,000 worth of USDC, USDT, or WETH will be allocated to deploy Uniswap liquidity pools and configure trading parameters.\n\nEach milestone is listed on the OpenxAI fundraising page, allowing backers to contribute using ETH, USDC, USDT, or WETH. Backers can claim OPENX tokens only when a milestone is successfully reached. When the community vote confirms a milestone is achieved, funds are released to the appropriate team(s) or executor, along with a flash reward for milestone completion. If a milestone fails, backers' funds are returned, along with 1 OPENX per $1 contributed as an appreciation reward for participation.\n\nSince backers can only claim their tokens upon milestone completion, they are incentivized to stay actively engaged in the community rather than simply funding a project and moving on. This approach prevents bad actors and malicious activities by ensuring funding is tied to actual progress fostering a collaborative environment where backers and builders work together to ensure success. The OpenxAI DAO has dispute mechanisms and a veto voting system to prevent abuse and uphold fairness in fund distribution.\n\n## Basics\n- Funds are locked in smart contracts and released only when predefined milestones are met.\n- Each milestone is publicly listed with clear objectives and funding details.\n- Funds are publicly tracked and verified, ensuring full transparency.\n- Backers use ETH, USDC, USDT, or WETH and can only claim their OPENX tokens when a milestone is confirmed.\n- Risk Mitigation for Backers â€“ If a milestone fails, funds are refunded, with 1 OPENX per $1 contributed as an appreciation bonus.\n\n## Scope of Work\n- Deploy Uniswap liquidity pools and configure trading parameters.\n- Implement smart contract mechanisms to enforce milestone-based fund releases.\n- Develop a real-time fundraising dashboard for tracking milestone progress and fund disbursement.\n- Enforce tiered funding limits to prevent concentration of token ownership.\n- Establish secure token claim mechanisms to ensure rewards are distributed only upon milestone completion.\n- Conduct smart contract security audits to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure fair execution.",

    "name": "Launch OpenxAIDAO & Governance",
    "description": "## Overview\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a self-governing system where decisions are made collectively by its members rather than a central authority. DAOs leverage smart contracts to automate governance, execute treasury management, and enforce transparent decision-making processes. OpenxAIDAO is the core governance entity of OpenxAI, responsible for managing funding allocations, setting development priorities, and overseeing ecosystem expansion. It ensures that decision-making is fully decentralized, transparent, and community-driven by leveraging on-chain smart contracts and token-based voting mechanisms.\n\nOpenxAIDAO is built using AragonDAO modules, customized by the Openmesh team to fit the specific needs of OpenxAI. This integration provides a robust and scalable governance infrastructure, enabling efficient proposal execution, decentralized treasury management, and seamless community participation. Special thanks to AragonDAO for its foundational framework, which has been adapted to align with OpenxAI's decentralized governance vision.\n\nGovernance participants include OPENX token holders and Verified Contributor NFT holders, who can submit and vote on proposals that shape OpenxAI's future. OpenxAIDAO ensures equitable participation, preventing governance centralization and securing treasury funds through automated smart contract execution.\n\nThe governance framework consists of proposal submissions, quadratic voting, veto rights, and treasury management tools, ensuring that fund distribution follows clear, community-approved milestones. Treasury allocations are only released upon successful project execution, creating accountability and minimizing risk. The governance model also includes dispute resolution mechanisms, preventing abuse while upholding fair and secure decision-making.\n\nThe core purpose of OpenxAIDAO:\n- Power is distributed among token holders, preventing centralized control.\n- Treasury allocations are governed by community-approved smart contracts, ensuring accountability.\n- Members propose, vote on, and fund initiatives that align with the ecosystem's growth.\n- Smart contracts execute governance decisions without intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies and risks.\n- Governance mechanisms, including veto rights and structured proposal evaluation, prevent misuse of funds.\n\n## How It Works\n- Token holders and Verified Contributor NFT holders can propose funding allocations, development initiatives, and strategic partnerships.\n- Quadratic Voting & Veto System. A weighted voting system ensures that decision-making power is balanced, preventing governance centralization.\n- Treasury-Controlled Smart Contracts. Funds are only disbursed when milestone-based funding requirements are met and validated by the DAO.\n- A transparent interface for proposal tracking, voting history, and funding approvals.\n- Dispute Resolution Mechanisms. A structured governance process to resolve conflicts, preventing misuse of treasury funds.\n\n## Scope of Work\n- Deploy OpenxAIDAO smart contracts to facilitate decentralized governance operations.\n- Implement quadratic voting, veto mechanisms, and proposal execution frameworks.\n- Integrate OpenxAIDAO modules into the user dashboard.\n- Develop a governance dashboard with real-time proposal tracking and funding status.\n- Integrate multi-signature security for treasury management and fund disbursement controls.\n- Conduct security audits on governance contracts to prevent vulnerabilities and unauthorized actions.\n- Establish a community onboarding framework to educate new participants about governance roles and responsibilities.",
